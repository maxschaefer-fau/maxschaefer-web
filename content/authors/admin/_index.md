Maximilian Schäfer (S'15, M'19) received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany in 2019. Currently he is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Digital Communications](https://www.idc.tf.fau.eu) at FAU. His research is focused on multidimensional systems theory and signal processing with applications in the modelling, design and analysis of molecular communication systems, as well as audio signal processing. Since 2023, his work has expanded to the development of experimental molecular communication systems.  

Maximilian has given several invited talks and tutorials on the modelling of molecular communication systems and on the Internet of BioNanoThings, including a tutorial at the IEEE Global Communications Conference in 2024. He has received a fellowship from the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation and the Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art for his research on the Internet of BioNanoThings. He also received multiple Best Paper Awards including two from the ACM International Conference on Nanoscale Computing and Communication in 2022 and 2024. 

He serves as a Steering Committee Member of the Workshop on Molecular Communications, as the Educational Services Coordinator of the Technical Committee "Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications” of the IEEE Communications Society, and as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications.
