Maximilian Schäfer studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. He received the degree "Doktor-Ingenieur" in electrical engineering from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. He worked with the chair of [Multimedia Communication and Signal Processing](https://www.lms.tf.fau.de), and currently as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [**Institute for Digital Communications**](https://www.idc.tf.fau.de) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. His research is focussed on multidimensional systems theory and the modeling of distributed parameter systems with applications in **molecular communications** and **sound synthesis**.
