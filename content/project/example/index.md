The EU defines an active implanted medical device (AIMD) as a device that relies on electrical energy or a source of energy other than that produced directly by the human body or gravity, intended to be implanted, into the human body. The modern demand for medical facilities, the burden of chronic diseases, and technological advancements are the major factors contributing to the growth of the use of AIMDs. The development of AIMD is limited by the restricted possibility of communication to either control or monitor their function being buried inside the body. ERMES project is developing a new concept for information transfer between medical doctors (MD) and AIMDs using synthetic molecular communication (MC). MC is a bioinspired communication strategy that involves the use of molecules to encode and transport information. ERMES aims to apply the concept of synthetic MC to enable medical doctors to communicate with future AIMDs.

Methodological Approach: 
- Selection and chemical design and synthesis of the suitable molecular messengers,
- Design and validation of injection and modulation schemes for molecular messengers propagating in the body's vascular system allowing MD to communicate the desired information towards an AIMD
- Development of detection strategies for chemical messengers inside the bloodstream released by the AIMD, and the investigation of suitable concepts to ensure reliable and secure communication between the AIMD and MD
