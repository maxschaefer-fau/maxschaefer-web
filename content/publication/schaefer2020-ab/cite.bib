 abstract = {Physical accuracy of virtual acoustics receives increasing attention due to renewed interest in virtual and augmented reality applications.
So far, the modeling of vibrating objects as point sources is a common simpliﬁcation which neglects effects caused by the spatial extent.
In this contribution, we propose a technique for physical modeling of distributed sources and their radiation into the environment. 
In particular, we consider the modeling of a guitar string oscillating in a two-dimensional room. The room and the string rely on well established physical descriptions that are modeled in terms of transfer functions. The connection of string and room is given by a connection matrix that deﬁnes the coupling between the characteristic string and room modes. The proposed structure is analyzed by numerical evaluations and sound examples on the supplementary website.},
